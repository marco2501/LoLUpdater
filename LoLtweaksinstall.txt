Locations of League of Legends.

Be sure to know where your League of Legends is installed before continuing.

If you're like me your LoL is installed in..
- C:\Riot Games\League of legends\

Typical Garena players have their LoL installed here. That is for 64 bit Windows
- C:\Program Files (x86)\GarenaLoL\GameData\Apps\LoL

If your have a 32 bit Windows then your LoL Directory will be here
- C:\Program Files\GarenaLoL\GameData\Apps\LoL

If you have Garena in the Philippines your LoL Direcotry will be here
-C:\Program Files (x86)\GarenaLoLPH\GameData\Apps\LoLPH

**Pay attention to where your LoL is installed in and you will be fine**

**Also if you moved your LoL its ok. If you renamed "League of Legends" to "League of Toxic Players"
Thats ok too just make sure you point to the folder that contains "lol.launcher.exe" 
(i'm not sure if garena players have to worry about renaming it)**
